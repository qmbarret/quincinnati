# Notes!
Here is where I will be taking my notes for CS 260. It is definitely a work in progress and I'll be trying my best to keep it relatively neat and ordered, but we'll see how that goes.

## GitHub
### Basic Git Commands
First command to get started is __clone__:
```
git clone url
```
This clones a repository from GitHub to your local device where the code will be worked on.

Next would be the combination of using __commit__ and __push__:
```
git commit
git push
```
As you can imagine, __commit__ is to "commit" changes that we've made in our code environment. I should always include a comment when you commit, saying what I worked on and what I changed/added. __Push__ is to "push" the changes we've made in our code environment to GitHub.

The other side is to use __pull__:
```
git pull
```
__Pull__ "pulls" any changes that have happened to the repository on a different machine or environment or whatever.
